The first thing I noticed in Dr. Jose Rizal’s life was that he lived a simple one. He did not choose to have a luxurious life like the most of us have wanted. Even before he became under surveillance by the Spaniards, he had lived his life as simple as possible. I think it was the work of his parents that made him lived like this. I strongly believe that one’s lifestyle is influenced mostly by their parents. I learned from the life of Rizal the importance of taking part of the parents to their children’s morals.

The second thing that I observed from the life of Rizal was his calmness and ability to think rationally even in the most complicated circumstances. His advocacy of Philippine Independence is by legal and peaceful way that is why he wrote many books in order to fire-up the revolutionary spirit of the Filipinos.

As an educated man…

Rizal’s philosophy of education centers on the provision of proper motivation in order to strengthen the great social forces that make education a success, to create in the youth an innate desire to cultivate his intelligence and give him life eternal. In this philosophy, I learned the value of education as a stepping stone towards gaining success for myself and for my country. Since there is an enough motivation to study and explore by wisdom, I made this an encouragement to myself that education shall not only stop within the corners of classrooms but shall also extend until the corners of the world. Rizal’s belief that waking up the innate desire of every Filipino youth to cultivate his intelligence is such a great thing that every individual has to ponder. His philosophy was affirmed by his educational attainment, thus giving a strong support of his educational philosophy and giving him the credibility to talk such path towards educational success.

As a religious man…

Rizal did not believe in the Catholic dogma that salvation was only for Catholics and that outside Christianity; salvation was not possible even if Catholics composed only a small minority of the world’s religious groups. Nor did he believe in the Catholic observation of fasting as a sacrifice, nor in the sale of such religious items as the cross, medals, rosaries and the like in order to propagate the Faith and raise church funds. He also lambasted the superstitious beliefs propagated by the priests in the church and in the schools. It only shows that Rizal has really taken hold of salvation as a free gift to everyone. This also shows that he opposes the Catholic teaching of money indulgence for the forgiveness of sins. Though Rizal was born from a closely-knit Catholic Family, he still fought for what is true. His religious philosophy approves a part of our Wesleyan beliefs and that is a good thing that we should be happy about. Furthermore, I learned that eventhough he has gone that far in his attainments, he did not lose his humility and his faith to God.

As a political man…

Rizal’s guiding political philosophy proved to be the study and application of reforms, the extension of human rights, the training for self government and the arousing of spirit of discontent over oppression, brutality, inhumanity, sensitiveness and self love. Rizal cried out for the independence of his own country and his fellow men. In his cry, he made reforms, he plead through his writings and he courageously laid his opposition against the inhumane and brutal management of the Spaniards over the Filipinos. One thing I learned from his life is that he was not terrified with the strong power of the Spaniards but instead he let himself shine and speak up on the issue that he and his country is facing. This could be a strong passion and determination to set free a country that deserves liberty. I also observed on my readings that Rizal never craved for political power, but instead he served as a catalyst that silently works great in his own ways. At the end of his life, he has remained fighting for freedom, and until his last breath, he has fought a good fight eventhough it caused him his life.

As a socially-equipped man…

Rizal’s social philosophy dealt with;
1. man in society;
2. influential factors in human life;
3. racial problems;
4. social constant;
5. social justice;
6. social ideal;
7. poverty and wealth;
8. reforms;
9. youth and greatness;
10. history and progress;
11. future Philippines.
Basing on these philosophies, I can say that Rizal is a very humane, compassionate and benevolent citizen. He has dealt with social problems thru his popular books Noli Me T’angere and El Filibusterismo. He is an ambassador or social justice and equality, which is a very good thing that we should follow. If there were only thousands of persons like Rizal, I believe our society will be at good condition. I always hope I could be like him in some areas of his life, but I know that it is far from reality to happen. But what I am doing is that I am performing at my best, making every effort to become a productive individual in different aspects of life.
