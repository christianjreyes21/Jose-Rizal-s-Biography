MARTYRDOM HAPPENS only once in a lifetime. And lucky are those whose lives are given for the sake of their countries. History elevates them to the bastions of immortals to be long remembered by their people as inspirations and models to be emulated and idolized by mankind.
One among them was Dr. Jose P. Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines. A glimpse of his life showed he was born in Calamba, Laguna on June 19,1861, as the seventh child of Francisco Mercado Rizal and Teodora Alonzo Realonda. He was a novelist, a poet, historian, linguist, athlete, medical doctor, dentist and opthalmologist. He showed love for his country at an early age which he nurtured until his death. Notwithstanding the perils and dangers of protests and exposes during his time, he manifested his dissent in his two great novels, the Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, which embodied the frictions and antagonism during the Spanish rule, the resentment against Friar abuses, and the harsh conditions suffered by the Filipino people. He was greatly touched by the death of three famoust priests, Fathers Gomez, Burgos and Zamora, to whom his novel El Filibusterismo, was dedicated.
A peaceful reformist, Pepe, as Rizal was commonly called by his close associates, opposed taking arms against Spain, realizing that it would spell disaster for his people and could bring nothing but misfortune upon them. Instead, he opted for peaceful reforms. Based on his experience as a member of the La Solidaridad, a Filipino reform movement newspaper, he founded the La Liga Filipina with Andres Bonifacio who later founded the Katipunan as a radical offshoot of this movement after Rizal was exiled to Dapitan. However, because of alleged "rebellion and sedition" charges against him by the Spanish authorities, he was executed by the Spaniards in the early morning of December 30,1896 at Bagumbayan, now Luneta or Rizal Park. His death triggered many revolutionary movements and fired up the growing Katipunan rebellion that showcased Filipino valor against all odds. The love for Rizal and his ideals was a battlecry the Spaniards did not want to hear during their rule of the Philippines.
Dr. Jose P. Rizal was a brilliant individual. He served as an inspiration to me as an overseas Filipino. During his lifetime, he spent many years outside the Philippines, enriching himself through education, especially in Madrid, Spain. The distance did not diminish nor reduce his love for his country. Far from his motherland, he looked across the seas to find its strength, as well as its weaknesses, in order to uplift it from the abuses of foreign rule. My mind was too naive at the time I read about him. It never occured to that we are alike in some aspects... that of being overseas Filipinos here in the United States.
At one point in time, he was in San Francisco, California, and occupied a room at the former Palace Hotel (now Sheraton Palace Hotel) overlooking the Bay Area. Like him, I also want to be a doctor. We shared the same belief that students must be urged by patriotic ideals and by their passionate love for their country, the Philippines, love for truth and proper values of education. Dr. Jose P. Rizal had given proof of desiring liberty for his country, and he set down as a premise, the education of the people. His teachings greatly influence me, while I am here in the United States. Like him, I believe in people power and consider myself a modern Rizal youth of today, as the hope of my fatherland's tomorrow.
Whatever the truth may be, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are Filipinos, in thought, word and deed, and I am proud to be one. I was raised in the United States for the past fifteen years, and have partly adopted the American way of life. But still, I love my country, a dignified, free and prosperous Philippines. I would not let my character and integrity be overpowered by foreign culture. I still admire and praise whatever is foreign; however, I will never give up Filipino traditions, beliefs and moral values instilled in me by my parents. I will never degrade nor become ashamed of what was my own.
As the hope of tomorrow, and being at the prime of my life, I would like to be a role model for teeanagers for the upliftment of their educational values. This was our national hero's dream about the youth: to be the future of tomorrow, the future leaders. I would volunteer to lead them, to sponsor symposiums through the help of the Philippine Consulate and the Filipino-American communities and other organizations interested in joining hands to make this dream a reality. Most of the youth here in the United States enthusiastically embrace foreign culture. Precious few have knowledge of our Filipino ways, mores, traditions and culture. In truth, the United States half-consciously helped the Filipinos to grow toward maturity,progress and advancement but it would be abnormal without progress in other directions, like awakening. Education and the raising of the standard of living is an important factor.
Like Dr. Rizal, we must grow through our own struggle. He did it by himself, and did not reckon of course nor ask for help from across the sea. As overseas Filipinos, especially the youth, we must help each other. Let us restore in our minds a sign of hope for the others, who have not yet progressed as far as becoming model Filipinos here and in other parts of the world where we are regarded as immigrants, aliens, TNTs, contract or domestic workers, etc.
Filipinos, like Dr. Rizal, must look for the spring of national strength for the restoration of Filipino moral values. They must learn before it is too late what it means to be truly Filipino. Away from our country, from our national traditions, hopes and reams, Filipinos must do what they can to prove their worth and make themselves useful as members of the community. Loyalty to the Philippines is one of the traits that must be strong and active among us. Dr. Jose Rizal should be our inspiration while we are away from our homeland, and we must succeed in influencing Filipinos to look back and be united in foreign lands.
In this age of immigrant-bashing and racial discrimination, Filipinos, like Rizal, should strive hard to be good examples of law-abiding citizens in their adopted country. We should excel in every aspects of our lives and professions. Our people are known in many field of endeavor. Others even intermarried with Americans. Many foreign professionals, doctors, engineers and lawyers prefer to marry Filipinos. Famous immigration lawyer Attorney Michael J. Gurfinkel, an advocate of Filipino-American rights, paid tribute to our womanhood by marrying the former Millie Sta. Ana. Atty. Gurfinkel, many say, is an American but more Filipino at heart. Businesses and corporate entities prefer Filipino workers because they are hardworking and show loyalty to the compnay they work for.
In closing, I believe that the present and future youth leaders must move on. Theirs are the liberated minds of courageous intellectuals who are prepared to maintain and keep alive the principles and ideals for which our national hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal, had fought at great odds. We should strive more for recognition and untiy. Every overseas Filipino should have a bit of Rizal, our national hero, in himself.
