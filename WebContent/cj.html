The life of Jose Rizal was a truly inspiring story. Not just as an ordinary story of a Filipino but a story of a very intelligent and talented Filipino, who is ready to sacrifice his whole life just to give freedom and peace to his family, and own nation.

For one semester, I’ve known who really Rizal is. It might not all about him, but those learning’s and knowledge I learned, is enough to say to myself and to other Filipino and even not, that he deserves to be what he have known for today. And that is, the National Hero of the Filipino. His life was truly amazing and colorful for the hero’s experiences mold him to what God purposely do to him.

Jose Rizal, for my own insights, tells me the value of certain things which is important for the success of his life. That is God, Family, Country and Self. He could not reach as that far without God. The Lords is the most important one who could determine our success, just like as Rizal feared God and in return, he have been bless abundantly not by material things only  but a spiritual one. That is intelligence, skills, love, and compassion. Also the role of family is next important for Rizal had been blessed with a family who could guide him to what he really aims. Even nowadays, family is one of the foundations of a person’s character. Next one is country! For Rizal’s portray the love of the country as a means of loving his fellow Filipino, thus helping them to attain justice from the evil and corrupt priest and Spaniards who are mistreating them in their own land for God has created us to extend our help with our fellow as a symbol of glorifying Him. And last is Self. I have learned from Rizal’s life that you should make yourself fruitfully. He makes himself grow to wisdom and knowledge to use it in God’s purpose. He did not say to himself that he is not worth enough and live blind for what is happening in his environment. Thus, he is knows that he is a child of God.

Moreover, Rizal proved that pen is mightier than a sword. For his expertise in writings enable him to convince his whole fellowmen to attain justice, thus destroying an empire. For words flies wherever and ignites every man’s feelings. Just like as a saying says that word is powerful, there comes positive and negative in it. It could heal one’s heart but also harm another like a double edged sword. Rizal have a God fearing heart so that he have ignite change and peace and thus mean we Filipinos should have a good conscience and God fearing heart to impose positive changes.

If Rizal still lives in our generation, he will sure that all Filipino has an inspiration like him by learning that knowledge is everything that all Filipinos were educated even though they were poor, he will also not teach but he will let us understand what is with being Nationalistic and the importance of loving our own language. Rizal is the hero that is brave, he’ll fight for everything even for his own life and work, in the film I watched, he said that we do not need to shed blood, we can fight them with our own knowledge thus showing that we are equal to them. 

Thanks to Rizal for he inspires me and thanks to our professor who imparts and explains all this knowledge for us to better understand it.
